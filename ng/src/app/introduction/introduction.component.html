  Welcome to the Angular 11 Template App for DNN/2sxc

<p>
  This app shows you how to leverage Angular 11 inside DNN and 2sxc. It will show you how to...

<h3>Develop locally, run live in DNN</h3>
<p>
  You get up to 10x faster development when you can use live-compile and see the results in DNN from your local dev environment. Here's how it works:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>First you copy the app to your local drive (or clone the same repo to a local folder) and initialize everything (see checklist)</li>
  <li>Then you run <code>npm run local</code> in your console. This will start <code>ng serve</code> on <em>localhost:4200</em> and whenever you save a code file, it recompiles in seconds.</li>
  <li>Our connector code in the <code>_AngularIntegration.cshtml</code> will now auto-load all the default bits so it just works!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Devolop locally - auto-deploy to Dnn Server</h3>
<p>
  Since you'll do most of the Angular development locally, we made sure that deployment to the target server is super easy. This helps if you have a normal network connection. If you use FTP, you'll have to do the deployment manually.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the <code>package.json</code> there is a property <code>publish_path</code> containing the target where the live server is</li>
  <li>Running <code>npm run build-to-staging</code> or <code>npm run build-to-live</code> will auto-build and deploy to these editions on the live server</li>
</ul>
